Naive Bayes classifiers are a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayes’ Theorem. It is not a single algorithm but a family of algorithms where all of them share a common principle, i.e. every pair of features being classified is independent of each other. To start with, let us consider a dataset.One of the most simple and effective classification algorithms, the Naïve Bayes classifier aids in the rapid development of machine learning models with rapid prediction capabilities.
